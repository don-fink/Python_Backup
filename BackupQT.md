Next step is to create a "settings" part of the program.

First, I want to create a file (if it doesn't exist), or open if it does. Inside, I'll default to 1200 by 600 in main window size, or start with the last size when the program last closed.

Later, I'll specify whether the program should "sync" destination with the source, or simply add to it.

Now, the Settings window should be set up. I want to call the window from the menu.

A window should open with the items listed above
